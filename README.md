# Perturb-STNet
## Description
_Perturb-STNet_ is a generic framework for analyzing spatial and spatiotemporally resolved single-cell perturbation data. It identifies spatial and temporally differentially expressed regulators arising from the impact of perturbations. Perturb-STNet quantifies nested regulator variabilities and can validate different perturbation hypotheses or trajectories by specifying control and perturbed timelines. Unlike prediction-focused methods
