# Perturb-STNet: Fusion of Spatiotemporal and Network Models to Prioritize Nested Effects in Single-Cell Perturbations
## Description
_Perturb-STNet_ is a generic framework for analyzing spatial and spatiotemporally resolved single-cell perturbation data. It identifies spatial and temporally differentially expressed regulators arising from the impact of perturbations. _Perturb-STNet_ offers significant advantages over existing techniques. One key benefit is its ability to relax the traditional assumption of matching pairs between control and perturbed conditions in differential analysis. This flexibility allows for testing multiple hypotheses more effectively. The framework achieves this through a method called Differential Nested Effects (DNE), which compares regulator variability in cell-neighborhood network graphs between control conditions and combined control and perturbed conditions.

_Perturb-STNet_ analysis pipeline can be broken down into two major parts. The first part is to estimate a cell-neighborhood biological network and the second part uses the estimated network as leverage in spatiotemporal statistical modeling. While t
