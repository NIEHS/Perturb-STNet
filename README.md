# Perturb-STNet
## Description
Perturb-STNet is a generic framework for analyzing spatial and spatiotemporally resolved single-cell perturbation data. It identifies spatial and temporally differentially expressed regulators. In addition, *Perturb-STNet* is not limited to two-dimensional spatial coordinates; it has the potential to support three-dimensional spatial data by creating polyhedrons instead of polygon meshes for network nodes. Perturb-STNet quantifies nested regulator variabilities and can validate different perturbation hypotheses or trajectories by specifying control and perturbed timelines. Unlike prediction-focused methods
